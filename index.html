        <p>remember an apparition of a heavy warm weight on my chest, breaths becoming slowly
intertwined until eventually syncing into a slow melodic hymn. I remember the warmth of a small
pink star welling, pooling and forming the feeling of protection never before or since felt. A
feeling so raw and vulnerable, never to be duplicated and near impossible to describe. I’m
chasing the feeling of protection that is now lost to time, sand that whisked away from my
fingers and into the ever changing winds.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I remember how utterly terrified I was, every moment I thought of every potential downfall and
mistake. The feeling of shame and failure permeated my brain, and instead of fighting I became
a coward. I let go of the thing I dreamt about for years. I know it was the right thing for her, yet I
still miss the feeling I had on that leather couch. The uncomfortable ache in my body gave me
comfort, the feeling of dread on my way home at 2am was worth it to spend time.
But that no-longer exists, she moved on. I’m stuck in the past, occasional familiar smells or
colors remind me of all that happened. Flashbacks to traumas that my brain pretends were a
fabrication. Smiles in a crowd even remind me of that warmth. I know it’s not right, I’m irrational
and it’s over but I still occasionally dream about a fire that was extinguished long ago.
Angel numbers keep guiding me in a way, life is worth something even if i don’t enjoy it right
now.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
They say to love others you must first love yourself, so I have work to be done. Because I'm not
going to repeat my failures, I want the next time I feel that security to be one where I can
express my gratitude sincerely. I’m sorry to the ones if hurt, and i am thankful you allow me to
be in your mind at all.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
She turned to a whirlwind of sand, sifting through my fingers and into the endless pits beneath.
With the dunes growing disdain for my presence, the feet that once held firm began to slowly
submerge into the sharp granules. The further he sunk into the depths, with sand slowly etching
into his sides and carving into his face's features, the sand began to heat. For he was on the
precipice of hell, heat turning sand into a clear glass. What once offered peace scalded his
being to its very core, yet remained invisible now, transparent but present</p>

        <p>Unassuming, a little pile of blankets and hoodies lay on the same spot every day. To the
average onlooker it’s just a pile of clothes, a few hoodies that need some folding or maybe need
some hangers. A blanket out of place or used as an extra bit of warmth on a cold night. Maybe
to be warm in the office chair?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
But to me they are a mountain. A blockade to the simple bit of rest I want at the end of the day.
One last push to get to the safe space of the night. The beauty of have zero expectations, zero
worries, a nice dark room, and no talking. Just star gazing and soft music to whisper a chorus of
sweet heartbreaks in my ears.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
But still, the pile remains. It’s only there because I couldn’t muster the energy to fold it all. I get
like this every now and then. I’ll slowly start hating myself, seeing my own flaws more and more
and then basic tasks grow more and more difficult. I have high standards for myself but I feel
like I never do enough to reach them. It’s hard to love someone that doesn’t love themselves.
So the pile becomes one last hurdle.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
A slow grapple on the clothes and one nice heave lands them on my office chair to perpetuate
the cycle on day longer. The mountain still stands, no cracks in its foundation.
One day my music will hit different, food will taste better, progress will speed up, friends will
hang out more, and all the sudden that pile will disappear into thin air.
I hope it does soon</p>

        <p>I live for moments like this, as wind sways the grasses envelop me. I can feel the warmth of the
sun on my chest, my back cooled from the ground beneath me. The sky is so beautiful these
days. Thick cumulus clouds blanket the sky in overarching ribbons, allowing a brilliant blue to
shine through in thin ravines and valleys. As the clouds slowly dance along the sky, new
patterns emerge and vanish into view as if god was painting the heavens with a brush of the
familiar brilliant blue.
          
Day turns to night bringing another wonder of nature above all of its creatures. Cold lights
encroach on the days territory until eventually shinning through in the infinite void. The
diamonds in the sky turn to constellations of tales yet to passed on before eventually
overflowing into an ocean of glimmer. streams of brilliant greens, purples, and blues slowly give
way into curving rivers slowly gliding across the night sky as temperatures slowly drop.
As humans we take these natural beauties for granted because of how familiar they become.
Ever constant in our lives as we ants struggle on the ground in our medial tasks. But not the sky,
it’s on purpose is to hold the limitless potential of the universe and remind us of its majesty.
From the dark oceans that the leviathans roam, to the wings of a butterfly traveling to pollinate
the roses, to the explosive brilliance of a firework ceremony. I’ll never take them for granted
again.
         
“What are you looking at dork”, a shock shoots up my spine as I snap to reality. Red flushes my
face as I try to think of a single thing to say. Caught in a daydream after focusing in on her eyes
for maybe a tad to long to be unnoticed.
          
“Have I ever told you that your eyes are pretty?</p>

        <p>“She loves me, she loves me not”
Another rose petal graces the blades of grass with an effortless elegance that a living creature
dreams to replicate. Roses bring him peace when the world seems to crumble into ash. Every
night when the clock strikes midnight and all of gods creatures hum in a slow melodic drone, he
tends to the garden.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Watering cans, shears, pruners, trowel, and others liter the ground as if it were a crime scene.
Sweat drips as work manifests, the rose bush decided to sprout just outside the cottage window
so it is given the love it deserves for it to grow. Many others would have left it, others would
have dug it out but the farmer was appreciative of its generosity.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
From once just a bud, slowly creeping into the sunshine rays as if not to draw in predators, now
sprouts a beautiful bush ever-changing and evolving as days turn to months. While some days
the distance seems impossible to surmount, and others are mere step away, the watering can
will still always glisten its roots with nourishment before the sun rises again.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
No matter how confused, nor frightful his life has been, he always tends to his garden. For the
garden choose to be by his side, he returns the favor. Roses are a beauty he fears will not grace
him again, and no matter his trials, the roses will never wilt alone.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
The farmer prays for his hands to never graces a pesticide, for many flowers have fallen to his
black thumb. He still remembers them, but none were as beautiful or everlasting as the roses.
Surviving every season with ease and happily swaying in the wind no matter the hellfire
surrounding them. For they are special, he is not and is thankful they picked such a place to call
home.</p>

        <p>My once green sweatshirt is now covered in death. It makes me sick to my stomach as I see the
viscera soak through the fabric and spread its plague into the bed beneath it, leaving a stain of
misery ever darkening and growing on the freshly washed duvet cover.　　　　
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
It’s been months, salvaging the blanket has grown to become a Herculean task that is left to be
unanswered. Every single product that gives the hope of removing a stain has fought the battle
within the woven threads but all of them were false prophets. The black tar of decay has slowly
encroached farther within my home. It decrepitly sinks into the soft memory foam mattress and
the once vibrant and comfortingly thick rug, now damp and dark with the blood soaked into the
surface area. Pooling dark circles fill every footstep within its reach as if it were freshly soaked
soil from a torrential rainfall.

          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
The smell of death, a fog growing ever more dense billows with hatred and persistence as if
there were an attempted arson. Its smoke permeates my home, my clothes, and now my mind.
It remains invisible until the smell returns, the location may be random but the smell is the same.
So pinpoint that it pierces my brain deep to its core, a 12 gauge clearing the top of my skull and
painting the the fan above me. The smell of cherry blossom becomes a calling sign for the
reaper.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
A willing suicide lays on the mattress, wrists slit with its eyes half open. Slow gasps rattle out of
its ribcage as the remaining life slowly seeps into the area surround its final resting place. The
knife lodged in its abdomen so deep that it cracks its spine, a once yellow blade is now a dark,
bubbling maroon.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
It lays there with a smile, a slight grin on the otherwise soaked face.
Innocence now dead, with its only fading memory being the smell of her perfume and the
warmth of the steel dagger used to etch his heart, he slowly drifts to the void. Consciousness
slowly fading with his last memories being of looking into his own opaque eyes. Just another
victim of circumstance, another heartbreak for her but a suicide note for him. Reduced to a
number in her memory.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
A sharp gasp echos, crusted red eyes open and scan the newly discovered surroundings with a
pounding headache and blurred vision. Thick overarching spruce trees loam overhead casting a
shadow over his frame in the moonlight’s rays that splatter on the sidewalk. In front lays a
wooden door connected to a familiar home, an innocent visual that still manages to manifest the
bubbling resentment of his own shortcomings.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Every slow crunchy step towards his destination leaves a blood trail that an outdoorsman would
cry tears of joy over. By the final step the man seemed to be close to fainting, barely collecting
enough composure to numbly press the ancient doorbell. Peering down at the new scars left in
her wake, with a hoodie in hand, a new man folds his once prized possession and slowly bends
down to leave it at her doorstep. A new beginning, growth’s familiar suffering, and a now distant
smell of decay that will forever leave shockwaves</p>

        <p>A cathedral loams in the distance with faint glow of candle light, imposing itself on the silky black
blanket of the night sky decorated in stars so vibrant they seem to be windows into the sun
themselves. A red glow illuminates from the west, signaling a battle that tolls the bell to the end
of a countries prosperity.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Heavy clanks grow from the distance, turning to a solitary march as a singular knight treks
through the winding stone paved roadway. A warrior once filled with a valiant effort to rival an
army now places a tattered glove onto the cathedral’ leviathan worthy door and budges it open
with all the might his bloodied and broken exterior can muster. With fire slowly engulfing the
country side, the life of all creatures native to this region lay responsible in his hand.
Within the Cathedral is a shockingly peaceful sight, an environment so still it is as if time itself
was fearful of the wrath it would endure to budge. A goddess lay sprawled in a throne that has
lost its authority, writhing in pain from the loss she had endured. Although it stands true being
plated in the world’s finest gold and encrusted with rare gemstones that glimmer in the pink and
purple lights of the peering though the stained glass window now illuminated by the encroaching
hellfire.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Aphrodite, sobs uncontrollably as the knight crawls into frame, a loaning shadow whipping in the
candle light loams behind him as he sulks into the now-mortuary. Throwing his, far from intact,
helmet to the perfectly smooth white surrounding walkway, he stumbles his way to the foot of his
goddess’s alter. Peering up to see his gods face; slick with sorrow, he now understands her
sorrow in his presence. Blood slowly pools in her chest as her heart slowly weakens, mortally
wounded from the inability to protect the lands in-between.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Now with a heavy heart, only one option remains. For he failed to protect her from the flames of
war now slowly crackling and engulfing the cathedral, a worthy sacrifice will restore her vitality.
Flames slowly crawl past the doorway and singe the white silk as he begins to kneel. One last
exhale, his head lowers its focus to the earth below, drips of blood now forming. Her endured
suffering continues to slowly drip down her dress as a scrape fills the air.
The knight, broken from battles previous slowly removes the blackened chest plate from his
torso and places it to the ground at her feet. Eyes widen as her brain tries to process the events
starting to manifest, powerless to intervene. With one motion, a claymore chipped and eroded
with a slick red coating enters the air and is turned back towards the hellfire that awaits his
eternity.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Air fills his lungs for the last time before driving all his might into the forearms holding the hilt of
his own blades . Air is replaced with blood as it enters before he ignites the remaining fire within
his soul to rip the tecpatl across his chest , increasing the ferocity of viscera drowning him from
the inside out.
          　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Blinding pain scalds his very core before he lays down, finally accomplished. Although he may
be through, he was able to relay a debt far greater than the man he was. The saving of the
kingdom was worth the life now flowing from his neck and chest.</p>

          I don't even know because the possibilities would be literally fucking endless. 

          It is going to be so fucking freeing. I can;t wait to finally just move the fuck out.
          I could finally have a girlfriend over and not have to worry about who was over or if 
          anyone other than myself approves. I could go ride my bike to the gym everyday. I could
          Go to all the metal concerts I've wanted to see. I could do literally fucking anything. 
          I can'tm wait to get tattoos and all the fun things.</p>

        <p>I’m honestly kind of just sick of worrying about people’s unending fucking judgement on my life and 
the decisions I can or can’t make. I’m fucking tired of having to worry about relationships, going to do things
I want to do, having to bend a knee and people please out of fucking instinct. I don’t care if the things I find
exciting are stereotypically dangerous, I just want to go fucking explore my passions. Yeah, I want to use the 
money I have to buy a motercycle and protective gear and learn how to drive it around. I want to go drive 
2 or three hours to a city to go explore the music scene and enjoy some concerts. I want to go on hikes 
the push my limits, I want to try out some new fashion, I want to push the limits of my body to become
a stronger and better looking man. I want a lot of things but I’m restricted by the shackles connected 
to the stones of my parents will. I’m locked into a town that is filled with the absence of life and I 
just want out. I want to be free to go to a fun place, I want to be able to leave my house and not expect 
my parents to worry about me 24/7, I want to come home with a bike and not get kicked out,
I want to be fucking free from judgment. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I’m just tired of things being judged as too risky for me. I don’t give a shit anymore about too risky, 
I want to do it and I am going to go and do it. Ww3 is close and I don’t fucking have time. 

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Blunt, pointless, monotonous 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Life feels pointless, an arrow with no broad head. Waiting out the shot clock on life because the 
coach won’t let me off the bench. It feels like nothing I can do will help me go forward. 
Perpetually working on meaningless goals that turn into a jail cell. I know this feeling
will pass and I will be able to do great things, I won’t allow it any other way.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
July 2nd. 
Couldn’t sleep so I’m back at it. Same topic so I don’t wanna make a new page.   
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I keep getting the recurring day dream of slipping into some riding gear and going on a
sunset ride in the really pretty neighborhood close to my old elementary school. 
Just gliding on twisty roads and enjoying the breeze through a visor and happy tunes on my cardo. 
          　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I realize I haven’t been selfish in a long time. I realize I’m just afraid to act as my true 
self because that imposes on others that I have worth aswell. I struggle to say no to people 
and not add value to them even when I don’t want too, get dragged into shit I don’t want to, 
get guilt tripped easily and get hurt by playful banter easily. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
It all stemmed when I realized I wanted something just because I wanted it for once. 
I want the bike, everyone around me doesn’t respect my decision and looks down on me
for it but I want it so fucking bad. I just want to explore and experience it. 
They are okay with committing literal wildlife felonies but me on a bike is too much to ask. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I wish I could just dump my money into it and get it. I want to be selfish this one time. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
But I am going to practice being more “selfish” in ways to make my mind better. 
Make art I like and post it regardless of it bothers people, yearn for the 
dreams I want without regard for other peoples thoughts, engage in the things 
I want because I fucking want to. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
It all stems from just wanting to ride that bike. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
So basically, fuck everyone that makes me uncomfortable or doesn’t give a 
shit about how I’m doing or doesn’t even ask. I’m doing shit for me. 
I’m done initiating when I don’t have to and doing it when I want to. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Like that all comes from an inferiority complex I gained ever since I was a kiddo.
If you aren’t objectively better than, then you aren’t worth it. So it’s a point 
system based of hate in a way. I can just have something and enjoy it without feeling 
guilty if I didn’t earn it in a way. Add enough suffering to get joy back. I dunno. 
I realize I just want love where I am the one that is certain in it, 
I don’t wanna be the one to choose to leave. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
(Once again can’t sleep)
Must be this calorie deficit kickin my ass. I really wanna raid the pizza in the kitchen. Fuckkkkk that would be fire. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I lost my safety net on talking about this shit so I guess we do it the old fashion way, pen and paper. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Man do I hate being stuck here. I feel like I’m window shopping through piles of fun 
things to try and I’m stuck on the opposite side of the glass. For me the doors locked 
and I can just watch my friend go in perfectly fine without me. I dunno I just feel so trapped. 
And my first reaction is to side with my parents and be like well it is dangerous but that’s just 
the inferiority shit again, god damnit. FUCK I am done with this shit. I just wanna DO. Go and do 
shit with or without anyone’s approval or attendance. Fuck everyone except my day ones. 
If they don’t even wish my happy birthday then they can kill themselves. 

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Alittle ego death motivation (alt insta account)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
If you are no different or special compared to anyone else that means you are 
just as capable as the people succeeding around you. Allow yourself to fail and 
grow. Allow yourself to struggle and triumph over your goals. Love yourself 
because you don’t need to be special, you need to be yourself and allow yourself the chance to try. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
Mfs forget progressive overload, being okay with failure, and allowing yourself to rest after a hard set the second they leave the gym. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
July 2nd (side note) 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I forget why I don’t like hanging with my family but Jesus Christ my sister is a negativity
fountain over the smallest shit, my mom seems to always be bringing up a fatal crash or accident 
to be too fucking worried over, and my dad is mad half the time but gets me. FUCK. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
July 10th 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
If you can’t love yourself innately for who you are and keep working on yourself to finally enjoy
who you are then your goalpost will always stay out of reach. Know that you are innately 
love-able and work out of growth instead of avoidance. You need to walk towards positivity 
instead of running from negativity. Same action, different mentalities. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
It’s time to fail on purpose. Fuck it and strive for more. If you are gonna make where others haven’t you have to do things others haven’t to get there. 
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
If you don’t care about living or dying then you aren’t living for yourself. You are just people pleasing and ruining your 
life for others. Lock the fuck IN. Fuck their feelings or opinions and start living to earn being tired when you get in bed. </p>
